<h1>Membership</h1>

<h2>It is easy to join the Scientific Society!</h2>

<p>Life membership is &pound;20, Annual membership is &pound;10 if you
join at any time during the term.  Life membership is just that&mdash;you remain
a member after having left Oxford and are welcome back, even in your
old age.</p>

<p>You can join in by PayPal right now:</p>

<p>Membership entitles you to free entry to all the society talks,
normally &pound;2 on the door for non-members. This makes life
membership a really good deal. Even if you were to only come to two
talks per term there would still be a saving!</p>

<p>Each lecture is followed by a reception with drinks, snacks, and
the opportunity to talk to the speaker and meet fellow science students.</p>

<p>If you would like to come to dinner with the speaker beforehand, please
<a href="mailto:jane.duncan@live.co.uk">email the President</a> (Jane Duncan,
St Hugh's) before 12 midday on the day of the talk.</p>

<p>We can also still take your money at society meetings or by post to the
Membership Secretary (Sophi Shanmuganathan, St Hugh's).  Cheques should be made
payable to "OU Scientific Society".  Contact
<a href="mailto:Sophi.Shanmuganathan@st-hughs.ox.ac.uk">Sophi.Shanmuganathan@st-hughs.ox.ac.uk</a>
if you have any questions about membership.</p>
