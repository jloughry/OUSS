<h1>Membership</h1>

<h2>It is easy to join the Scientific Society!</h2>

<p>Life membership is &pound;20, Annual membership is &pound;10 if you
join at any time during the term.  Life membership is just that&mdash;you remain
a member after having left Oxford and are welcome back, even in your
old age.</p>

<p>Membership entitles you to free entry to all the society talks,
normally &pound;2 on the door for non-members. This makes life
membership a really good deal. Even if you were to only come to two
talks per term there would still be a saving!</p>

<p>Each lecture is followed by a reception with drinks, snacks, and
the opportunity to talk to the speaker and meet fellow science students.</p>

<p>If you would like to come to dinner with the speaker beforehand, please
<a href="mailto:aimee.guha-roy@lmh.ox.ac.uk">email the President</a> (Aimee Guha-Roy,
LMH) before 12 midday on the day of the talk.</p>

<p>We can take your money at society meetings or by post to the
Membership Secretary (LinHao Fang, St Peter's).  Cheques should be made
payable to "OU Scientific Society".  You can also contact
<a href="mailto:linhao.fang@earth.ox.ac.uk">linhao.fang@earth.ox.ac.uk</a>
if you have any questions about membership.</p>
