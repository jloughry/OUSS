		<p>
			Cory Doctorow will give an informal lecture on
			new technologies giving rise to new problems that
			demand new regulations. He defends the idea that
			bad things happen when we try to regulate problems
			arising from new technologies, such as general
			purpose computers and networks, in the same way as
			we regulate old technologies like cars and guns.
